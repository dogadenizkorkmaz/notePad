# Java Notepad Application

This Java application simulates a basic Notepad program. The user can input text, which is then saved to a text file. When the program is restarted, it displays the last saved text.

## Description

The program performs the following operations:

1. Reads the last saved text from the file `notes.txt`, if any, and displays it.
2. Prompts the user to enter new text.
3. Saves the new text to the file `notes.txt`.
4. When restarted, it displays the last saved text to the user.

## File Structure

- `Notepad.java`: Java source code file containing the main program.
- `notes.txt`: Text file where the text is written and read.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Run the `Notepad.java` file to execute the program.
4. The program will display the last saved text, if any. Enter new text when prompted, and it will be saved to the file.
5. Upon restarting the program, it will display the last saved text again.
